# IPPDigital
(University project)  

Backend: php  
Frontend: Bootstrap  
Database: Postgres  

A short simulation of an online store. There are products and each product must belong to a category. Products and categories can be added and deleted (though a category can only be deleted if it has no products)

The images are stored in the server.

# Succulents
(Personal project)

Also a simulation of an online store. In this case there is no backend or database involved, only some js for behaviour.
Done as a challenge since there is no bootstrap (or similar frameworks) used, just pure css.

1. There is the post segment, with a content column and a sidebar

2. There is a product segment, which has all the pictures of the succulents. They slide with the info when hovered over. There is also a button for adding to the cart.

3. There is a contact page

4. If you click on the cart (upper-right corner), you can see your current cart's content and continue with the purchase.
